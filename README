RottenFlix adds little tomato icons beside each movie title that when clicked fetch the movie's rating from Rotten Tomatoes. The rating also functions as a link that points to the movie's page on Rotten Tomatoes.

I simply got tired of spotting an intriguing movie on Netflix and then having to manually look up its rating on Rotten Tomatoes. RottenFlix represents the fastest and most convenient way I could come up with to close the gap.
